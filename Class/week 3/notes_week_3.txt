-There was no need to bracket the tests in the previous grade assignment, 
 I could have simply tested one case for each grade:
 $score<60?"F":
 $score<70?"D": etc...

-However! when we move to the if statement method, my original way of testing would be  correct.

-Homework assignment: Write program that calculates straight time and over time:
	Straight time <= 20 hours
	Double time   <= 40 hours
	Triple time   <  40 hours
-input hours and pay rate and get full paycheck
-Utilize ternary, if/else, and switch statements
